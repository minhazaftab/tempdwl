User Experience with SpaceDesk and GPU Switching on Lenovo LOQ 83DV00LWIN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Laptop Configuration:
- Model: Lenovo LOQ 83DV00LWIN
- Integrated GPU: Intel UHD Graphics
- Dedicated GPU: NVIDIA RTX 4050
- GPU Switching Technology: Advanced Optimus and Hybrid Mode
- MUX Switch: Present but currently disabled

Issue:
- User is using SpaceDesk to extend display wirelessly to a phone.
- When SpaceDesk is activated, the system switches to the integrated GPU (iGPU).
- Even GPU-heavy tasks remain routed through the iGPU.
- Discrete GPU (dGPU) and Optimus modes are disabled, preventing display output from switching to RTX 4050.

Technical Explanation:
- SpaceDesk creates a virtual display adapter that Windows treats as a regular monitor.
- In Hybrid Mode, all display output is routed through the iGPU, even if the dGPU is rendering.
- Wireless display mirroring is CPU and iGPU-friendly, and avoids using the dGPU for efficiency.
- Advanced Optimus cannot reroute virtual displays to the dGPU.
- The MUX switch must be enabled to allow direct dGPU output, but it is currently disabled.

Troubleshooting Steps:
1. Check Lenovo Vantage or BIOS for MUX Switch:
   - Reboot and enter BIOS (usually via F2 or Delete).
   - Look for GPU Mode or MUX Switch settings.
   - If available, set to Discrete GPU Only.

2. Use a Physical Monitor:
   - Connect via HDMI or USB-C (both wired to RTX 4050).
   - Allows full dGPU rendering and output.

3. Use SpaceDesk in Wired Mode:
   - If supported, use USB tethering or wired mirroring for better GPU usage.

4. Monitor GPU Usage:
   - Use Task Manager → Performance → GPU Engine
   - Or NVIDIA Control Panel → System Information

Additional Notes:
- Assign specific apps to use RTX 4050 via Windows Graphics Settings.
- Lenovo Vantage may restrict GPU mode changes based on power source or display configuration.
